# DeepLearning-IndividualAssignment1-Abalone

This project predicts the age of abalone using a neural network built in PyTorch. It includes custom data preprocessing, two different neural network models (baseline and modified) and a complete training and evaluation pipeline with early stopping, regularization and test set inference.

## How to Run the Code?

- Open the main folder in Visual Studio Code or any other code editor.
- Install the needed libraries by running the following command line in the terminal:
  - **pip install -r requirements.txt**
- Run the code inside of the ring_prediction.ipynb
  - **OPTIONAL**: set the **SKIP_TRAINING** global variable into **'False'** to retrain the model and to see the training process.

## For More Details

Please refer to the AbaloneAgePrediction.pdf to see the summary and justification report for a full explanation of the model architecture, training decisions and results.
